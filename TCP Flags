Tcp flags:
is the layer 4 transport
witch contains important information
-includes a set of bits called TCP flags

the flags control the payload
SYN- Synchronize sequence numbers
PSH- push the data to the application without buffering
RST- reset the connection
FIN- lat packet from the sender

Maximum transmission Unit (MTU)
Maximum ip packet to transmit
-but not fragment

-fragmentaion slows thiisngs down
losing fragment loses an entire packet
requires overhead along the path

difficult to know the MTU all the way through the path

"The maximum ip packets is 1500 bytes" 

What is ip fragmentation?
is the how many bytes that is allowed to transfare
if the network is 16 bytes it will sabrated the byte 

Trabelshooting MTU
