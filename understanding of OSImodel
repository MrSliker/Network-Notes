There are 7 layers of OSI model

layer 1- physical
layer 2- data
layer 3- Network 
layer 4- Transport
layer 5- Session 
layer 6- Presentation
layer 7- Application

Layer 1: The physics of the network
Is the connection between one network to other network by..
-Singnaling, cabling, connectors
-is not about protocols
there is:"Hub" and “media converter”
“If you have physical problem”
-Fix your cabling, punch downs, etc
-run loopback tests, test,replace cables
swap adapter.

Layer 2: Data Link Layer
is the connection with MOC address between two network
-The basic network “language”
the foundation of communication at the data link layer
-The “switching” layer and “bridge”

Layer 3: Network Layer
is the connection betweent two network with IP address (internet protocol)
packets or the routing layer
use: router and basic firewall

Layer 4: Transport Layer
is the jop to transport the websites to the user in saprated frames
The “post office” layer

-TCP(Transmission control protocol) 
-UDP(User Datagram protocol)

Layer 5: Session Layer
is the jop to start or stop or reset the communication from and to the user
-control protocol
-tunneling protocol

Layer 6: Presentation Layer
Is the function that computer luaguage is communcate with other
-charater encoding
-application encryption
- ofter combined with layer 7

Layer 7: Application layer
is the websites and pages we see
-HTTP , FTP , DNS , POP3

Steps in how conversation is ocare
Application: https://gmail.com
Prsentation: SSL encryption
Session: Liknk the presentaion and application layer
Transport: TCP encapsulation
Network: Ip encapsulation
Data link: Ethenet or MAC address
Physical: Electrical signals
